Netflix is a popular OTT platform where there are so many contents to watch which are from a lot of countries and there are a lot of genres to watch. So, the goal is to predict clusters by similar content by matching text-based features which in our case is the description column which is a small plot summary of the contents. This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled.
