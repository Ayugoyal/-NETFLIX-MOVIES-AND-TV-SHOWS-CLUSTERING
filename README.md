Netflix is a popular OTT platform where there are so many contents to watch which are from a lot of countries and there are a lot of genres to watch. So, the goal is to predict clusters by similar content by matching text-based features which in our case is the description column which is a small plot summary of the contents. This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

SUMMARY: NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV SHOWS CLUSTERING
The Mobile Price Range analysis is done by group of 3 members-M.Sameer Ahamed, Ayush Goyal, Nitesh Bhowmick. In this project we got NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV SHOWS CLUSTERING as a CSV file.

As we downloaded the data as CSV file from Almabetter Capstone project dasboard we encoded the file in colab notebook trough mounting the drive. All members from the group participated throughout the project with great efforts.

The cleaning of data was done and created the new cleaned dataframe consists of columns which were required for analysis.Each and every column were compared to gain the knowledge for analysis. Worked individually gaing some insights doing some EDA.The first difficulty was the missing data in the dataset & one Column Name, so we renamed the columns by using dictionary format. In the dataset tehre are # columns which contain more NaN Values, so i filled up with requird values & another there are another 2 columns which contains less NaN Values, so, i remove those particular rows which contain NaN values . From graphs we cleared the Type of shows, ratings, Production Growth based on type of the content & release_year, Genre, Duration, Country, Title & Cast.

After that I created model with 2 different Clustering Algorithims & we conclude that K Means is best for identification than Hierarchical as the evaluation metrics also indicates the same.
